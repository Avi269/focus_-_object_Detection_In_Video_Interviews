# 📄 Tutedude SDE Assignment Submission
## Focus & Object Detection in Video Interviews

### 🎯 Project Overview
A comprehensive video proctoring system that detects candidate focus and flags unauthorized items during online interviews using computer vision and AI detection.

---

## ✅ Requirements Implementation Status

### 1. Frontend (Interview Screen) ✅
- **Simple web page** where interviewer can see candidate's video
- **Video recording/storage** with upload functionality  
- **Real-time detection** of focus & suspicious events
- **Live alerts** for "User looking away", "Phone detected", etc.

### 2. Focus Detection Logic ✅
- **OpenCV & MediaPipe integration** for computer vision
- **Focus detection**: Flags if not looking at screen for >5 seconds
- **No face detection**: Flags if no face present for >10 seconds  
- **Multiple faces detection**: Identifies multiple people in frame
- **Event logging** with timestamps for all detections

### 3. Item/Note Detection ✅
- **Object detection** using YOLO/TensorFlow concepts
- **Mobile phone detection** with high accuracy
- **Books/paper notes detection** in real-time
- **Extra electronic devices** identification
- **Real-time flagging** and logging of all events

### 4. Backend (Preferred) ✅
- **Database storage** (SQLite/PostgreSQL ready)
- **RESTful API** to fetch focus + item detection reports
- **User management** with role-based access
- **Interview scheduling** and management system

### 5. Reporting ✅
- **Proctoring Report** with all required fields:
  - Candidate Name
  - Interview Duration  
  - Number of times focus lost
  - Suspicious events (multiple faces, absence, phone/notes detected)
  - **Final Integrity Score = 100 – deductions**

---

## 🎁 Bonus Features Implemented

- ✅ **Eye closure/drowsiness detection**
- ✅ **Real-time alerts** for the interviewer
- ✅ **Audio detection** (background voices) - framework ready
- ✅ **PDF/CSV export** of reports
